      <h3> Scandals in the Speedrunning Community </h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.twingalaxies.com/">Twin Galaxies</a> has had a lot of talk about it. There was a speedrunner for the Atari game Dragster who was recently stripped of his records and got his world record taken away from him. He also had a Guinness world record taken away from him.
      <br> However, there is another, more infamous, more devious speedrunner. His name is Billy Mitchell. He set a bunch of records (he was the first person to apparently score over one million points) and actually was in a Donkey Kong documentary called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zhMlFOyZvQ">King of Kong</a>. However, there has been a bunch of evidence that he was cheating and the referee was actually the same guy who cheated at Dragster. Here's a video breaking down how exactly he cheated.</p>
